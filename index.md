  Hi! My name is Renee Wrysinski. I'm a junior at Rice University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Computer Engineering, as well as a minor in Engineering Design.

  Outside of academics, I'm a manager and meechanic at Rice's student-run bike shop, [Rice Bikes](https://www.ricebikes.com/).
