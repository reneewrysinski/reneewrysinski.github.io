  Hi! My name is Renee Wrysinski. I'm a junior at Rice University pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Computer Engineering, as well as minors in Engineering Design and Neuroscience. Outside of academics, I'm a manager and mechanic at Rice's student-run bike shop, [Rice Bikes](https://www.ricebikes.com/), and also the Electrical Team Lead for Rice Robotics Club's Research and Development team. 

  I'm currently seeking full time roles for after I graduate in May of 2026, and am particularly interested in pursuing a career in embedded systems, hardware engineering, or design engineering. Feel free to explore this site to check out some of my past projects. If you have any questions or want to connect, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:reneewrysinski@gmail.com">reach out</a>!
